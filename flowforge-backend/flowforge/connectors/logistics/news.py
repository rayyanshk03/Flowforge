"""LIVE news watcher — keyless Google News RSS scanned for port disruptions.
OWNER: P2 (P3 assisted).

Structured feed only (RSS/XML via stdlib urllib + xml.etree): no HTML scraping,
no API key, no paid services. Gated behind FLOWFORGE_NEWS=1 in the live
connector and degrades SILENTLY — any network or parse failure yields zero
signals, so the weather + synthetic layers keep the demo alive.

A headline counts as a disruption only when it names a known port from the
route network AND contains a strong disruption keyword. Matched ports join the
same blocked-port UNION the weather layer feeds, so the solver routes around
storms and news events together.
